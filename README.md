Simple auth app, written in clean architecture(it's an overkill for such simple app). Riverpod for state managment.
Currently connected to a server from another personal project, which has nothing in common.
There is no actual authorization atm.

There are some TODO's in the code, explaining what I would do next, or what thoughts I had when I wrote that piece of code.
